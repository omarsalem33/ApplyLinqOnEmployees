# ApplyLinqOnEmployees

This repository demonstrates the usage of LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) to perform various operations on an employee dataset in C#. LINQ simplifies querying and manipulating data in .NET applications, making it a powerful tool for developers.

## Features

- Filtering employees based on various criteria
- Sorting employees by properties (e.g., name, age, or salary)
- Grouping employees by specific attributes
- Aggregating data (e.g., finding the sum, average, or maximum values)
- Projecting data into custom objects or anonymous types

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: The programming language used to implement the solution.
- **.NET Framework/Core**: For building and running the application.
- **LINQ**: The core technology for querying and manipulating data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download): Version 6.0 or later
- A code editor like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omarsalem33/ApplyLinqOnEmployees.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ApplyLinqOnEmployees
   ```

3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

4. Build the solution to restore dependencies.

## How to Run

1. Open the terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

2. Run the application using the .NET CLI:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to explore LINQ operations on the employee dataset.

## Project Structure

- **/Models**: Contains the `Employee` model class that represents the employee entity.
- **/Services**: Includes LINQ operations and methods.
- **/Program.cs**: Entry point of the application.

## Example Usage

- **Filter Employees**: Find all employees earning above a specific salary threshold.
- **Sort Employees**: Order employees by their names in ascending order.
- **Group Employees**: Group employees by department and calculate average salaries.
